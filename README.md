# MimiRust - Hacking the Windows operating system to hand us the keys to the kingdom with Rust.
<p>MimiRust is a program based on the wdigest attack vector implementation employed within Mimikatz. MimiRust has been made to extract pain-text passwords out of the memory of certain Windows operating systems. Also like the name suggests MimiRust has been made in the Rust language.</p>
##Which operating systems does MimiRust support
<p>It supports the following operating systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Win7 x64</li>
  <li>Windows Server 2008 x64</li>
  <li>Windows Server 2008R2 x64</li>
  <li>Win8 x64</li>
  <li>Windows Server 2012 x64</li>
  <li>Windows Server 2012R2 x64</li>
  <li>Win10_1507(and before 1903) x64</li>
</ul>
<br>
##Why was MimiRust made
<p>I was bored in my first year of my CyberSecurity bachelors, as there wasn't anything cyber related being taught. Thus I decided I was going to start my own project, I already knew of Mimikatz for a while and why it was used however I did not know how it did it's thing though, so to get this knowledge I decided to start learning how it does it's thing and thus mimiRust was created.</p>
<br>
##Future plans
<p>For the future I want to add more functionality/capability to MimiRust (like getting NTLM hashes) so it can be fully employed inside of redteam operations.</p>
